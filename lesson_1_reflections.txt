How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Compared the code of each line in the old and the new versions of the file and spotted the difference between the code.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    It enables me to keep a track of all the changes made to the code and can later help me in spotting where I went wrong, if the code is not working as expected.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

   Git Versioning system is more focussed on code changes and is meant for developers while Google docs is more focussed on document changes and is designed for content writers and not coders

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    The command git log can be used to view the complete history of all the commits made to the versioning system.

    By using git diff the actual code difference between two files can be viewed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can always go back to the previous version , compare it with the current version and see what change has caused the breakdown

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
   Use it for version control of any code that I am developing or working on
