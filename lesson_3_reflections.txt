When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I would like my code to available for reviews or suggestions by other users

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The developer has more control when the changes are pulled manually as compared to automatic syncing
